Hi! I'm "ellos". I'm starting out as a developer. Some of my interests are compilers, systems programming, ethical ai development, game development, robotics, and functional programming. 
My favorite programming languages are Haskell and C. I use Emacs for the majority of my text editing needs. 

Current Major Projects:

1. [gigi-lang](https://www.github.com/ellos0/gigi-lang)
1. [mp](https://www.github.com/ellos0/mp)
1. [marble-hiking](https://www.github.com/ellos0/marble-hiking)
