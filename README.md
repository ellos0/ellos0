Hi! I'm "ellos". I'm starting out as a developer. Some of my interests are compilers, systems programming, ethical ai development, game development, robotics, and functional programming. My favorite programming languages are Haskell, C++, and Python. I use emacs for the majority of my text editing needs. 

I currently haven't achieved any great feats of programming, but I am working on a programming language named Gigi (after my dog). I write all my code under open source licenses, but I haven't made any notable contributions to other open source projects as of now.
