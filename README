Hi! I'm "ellos". I'm starting out as a beginner programmer. 

Some of my interests are compilers, systems programming, ethical ai development, game development, robotics, statistics, stenography, and functional programming. 

My favorite programming languages are Haskell and C. I use Emacs for the majority of my text editing needs. Additionally, I use MacOS and Gentoo Linux as my daily drivers.
