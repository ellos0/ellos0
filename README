Hi! I'm "ellos". I'm starting out as a beginner programmer. Some of my interests are compilers, systems programming, ethical ai development, game development, robotics, and functional programming. 
My favorite programming languages are Haskell and C. I use Emacs for the majority of my text editing needs. Additionally, I use MacOS and Gentoo Linux as my daily drivers. 

Current Major Projects:

1. gigi-lang (https://www.github.com/ellos0/gigi)
2. marble-hiking (https://www.github.com/ellos0/marble-hiking)
